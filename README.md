The effect is purely CSS a line moves forward and back also highlighting the circles.

## What is the JavaScript doing in this project?

Controlling this is JS.  The buttons are clickable allowing a user to move forwards/back.

### in summary
Clicking Next takes us forward a step
Clicking Prev takes us back a step
At the start Prev is grey
At the end Next is grey

There is a calculation to perform allowing us to move precisely between step 1 to 2, 2 to 3 and 4 to 4 and back again. This isn't a neat 100 / 4 = 25 as it looks, but there are really only 3 clicks.
